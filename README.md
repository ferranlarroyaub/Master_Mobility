# Master Mobility

This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks to read, process and study pedestrian mobility GPS trajectories, collected using the Wikiloc app. (https://www.wikiloc.com/) and exported in GPX files. 

The code is adapted to a particular experimental case, in which 18 groups of 3-6 people from "Barri Primer de Maig (Granollers, Spain)" participated by walking through the neighborhood while exploring and choosing particular places to peform a list of actions. They brough an IPAD tablet device with the Wikiloc open and recording the trajectory. 

- The folder "original data" contains the raw collected data, i.e., 18 GPX files with the trajectories of the different groups.
- The folder "processed data" contains the filtered and processed data in csv format (i.e., 18 csv files).
